```{r logo, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}

logo <- knitr::image_uri("<your-logo.png>")

htmltools::withTags(
  style("#TOC::before {
          background-image: url(",logo,");

# Hi!

This is a single lesson template.

# Make it your own

To add a logo, do two things:

1. Change the code chunk setting above from `eval = FALSE` to `eval = TRUE`.
1. Add your logo file within `knitr::image_uri()`, where `<your-logo.png>` is the file path to your logo image.


# Specially-styled questions

To use specially-styled questions like the ones below, place `<div>` tags around them like so: 

```
<div> class="question">

1. Your first question here.
2. You second question here.

</div>
```

<div class="question">
1. Your first question here.

2. You second question here.
</div>

# Goodbye!
